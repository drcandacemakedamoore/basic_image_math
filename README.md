This didactic notebook can be run live on my AWS server (http://52.4.107.176:8000/user/makeda/notebooks/repositories/notebooks/master/codenotebook_minus_one.ipynb#) with username: 'makeda' and password: 'besame mucho' 
, remove the ''. I put a copy here in case someone somehow trashes my server over there. It's much more fun and educational to run live.
